            <br><li>Assemble your Team</li>
                <p class="content">Sepak Takraw is played with two teams of three players with 2 substitutes.<br>
                <br>First you must have a server stands in the centre of the court to serve the ball over the net as hard as possible so it’s hard for the opponent team to defend.<br>
                <br>The left inside stands on the left front of the court also called feeder and objective is to control over the ball during the game, they also set the ball based on the striker.<br>
                <br>The right inside, also known as the striker or Killer, stands on the right front of the court. The goal of the killer is to strike the ball in the other team court and block spikes from the other team.</p><br>
                <li>Serve the ball</li>
                <p class="content">The designated team serves first, the feeder and the striker stand with one foot inside the serving circle either the feeder or striker tosses the ball to the server to start the match by using the feet outside the circle. 
                After initial serve, all players are free to move around the court also the other team can be anywhere in their court.</p>
                <li>Pass the ball to the striker</li>
                <p class="content">To respond to the serve, the defensive team will try to get the ball over the net within 3 touches of the ball. The Tekong and the Feeder both move around the court to pass the ball to the striker with 1-2 touches. The striker will use the final third touch to send the ball over the net.</p><br>
                <li> Pass the ball to the opponent </li>
                <p class="content">using only your feet and head play on until a team makes a fault. This occurs when the team doesn’t return the ball over the net within 3 touches, when a team wins a point, they get the next serve.</p><br>
                <li>Change the side of the court for a new set.</li>
                <p class="content">After one team gets to 21 (or 25) points, the set is over. To start a new set, the teams change sides of the court. The team that lost the previous set serves. When a team wins two sets, a new match is started.</p><br>
