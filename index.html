        <p class="content">Sepak Takraw may have been introduced to Southeast Asia by the Chinese,<br> who were inspired by the traditional game Cuju,<br> an ancient military exercise where soldiers play to keep a leather ball filled with feathers airborne by kicking it back and forth between two or more people.<br> As the game evolved, the feather-stuffed ball was replaced by an air-filled ball with a two-layered hull.<br> Cuju is also considered by the International Football Association (FIFA) as the origin of football as a sport.
